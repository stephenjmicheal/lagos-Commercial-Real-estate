Exploration and Visualization: We've dugged into the cleaned data, uncovering hidden gems and presenting findings through compelling visualizations.

Valuation Measures: We've used two pivotal performance indicators, Gross Rental Yield and Net Operating Income, to assess the value of commercial properties.

Actionable Insights: Finally, we offer a set of recommendations and valuable insights to guide your journey as you navigate the commercial real estate investment in Lagos.
